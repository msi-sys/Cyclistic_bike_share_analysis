# CYCLISTIC-BIKE-SHARE-ANALYSIS

# Project Summary
Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago. The company wants to increase its annual memberships and the marketing team believes that converting casual riders into annual members is key to long-term growth.

# 🚨 The Problem 
Cyclistic wants to grow its business and increase revenue by converting more casual riders into annual members. However, the company currently lacks insights into why casual riders aren’t making the switch to membership

# 🎯  The Objective
As a data analyst, my task was to analyze how casual riders and annual members differ in their riding behavior. This includes identifying patterns in ride frequency, duration, bike types used, and trip locations. By understanding the behavioral differences between these two rider groups, the marketing team can design targeted strategies to convert casual riders into loyal, paying annual members.
