## 📊 Project Overview

The Cyclistic bike-sharing company operates in a competitive market, and understanding its user base is crucial for strategic growth. This case study aims to analyze the usage patterns of Cyclistic bikes. By examining the data, we can provide insights that can help the company improve its services.

### Objectives

- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Analyze user behavior based on trip data.
- Create visualizations that highlight key findings.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project employs the following technologies:

- **SQL**: For data cleaning and analysis.
- **Tableau**: For creating visualizations and dashboards.
- **Python**: For data manipulation (if applicable).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting the analysis process.

## 📈 Data Sources

The data used in this analysis comes from the Cyclistic bike-sharing platform. The dataset includes information about bike trips, including:

- Trip duration
- Start and end locations
- User type (member or casual)
- Time of day and day of the week

You can also download the latest release of the project [here](https://github.com/msi-sys/Cyclistic_bike_share_analysis/releases). This will provide you with the necessary files to execute the analysis locally.

## 🔍 Analysis Process

The analysis follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Cleaning**: The raw data is cleaned using SQL. This involves removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting the data for analysis.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We perform EDA to understand user behavior. This includes examining trip duration, peak usage times, and differences between member and casual users.

3. **Key Findings**: We summarize the insights gained from the analysis. This may include trends in bike usage, popular routes, and recommendations for improving user experience.

## 📊 Visualizations

Visualizations play a crucial role in conveying insights. We create various dashboards using Tableau to illustrate our findings. Some key visualizations include:

- **Trip Duration by User Type**: A bar chart comparing average trip duration for members and casual users.
- **Heat Map of Popular Routes**: A heat map showing the most frequently used bike routes.
- **Usage Trends Over Time**: A line graph depicting bike usage trends over different months.

To view the visualizations, check the `visualizations/` directory. You can also download the latest release with the visualizations [here](https://github.com/msi-sys/Cyclistic_bike_share_analysis/releases).
